-How to deny access to edit other users pages by navigation via url (authorization probably)
-Update homepage look
-Add name line to the User model
-Add images to make the page look better
-assignments#create renders to assignments if it is not valid when it should just redirect back to it's own page(temporarily changed this to redirectback to the page but its a temp fix)
